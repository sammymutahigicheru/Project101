###  Doing coding interview questions while I'M learning data structures and algorithms 

I need to apply what I will be learning to solving problems so that I can't forget.Once I've learned a topic, 
and feel comfortable with it, like linked lists,I will be opening one of the coding interview books and do a couple of questions regarding 
linked lists. Then move on to the next learning topic. Then later, go back and do another linked list problem, 
or recursion problem, or whatever. But i'll keep doing problems while i'm learning. ``I'm not being hired for knowledge, 
but how I apply the knowledge. There are several books and sites recommended``. 
See here for more: [Coding Question Practice](#coding-question-practice). 

## The Daily Plan

Some subjects will take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.

Each day I take a Problem on a topic let's say graph theory, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in either:
  -java
  -kotlin
  -python
  -javascript

Why code in all of these yet only one language is required?
- Practice, practice, practice, until I'm sick of it, and can do it with no problem (some have many edge cases and bookkeeping details to remember)
- Work within the raw constraints (allocating/freeing memory without help of garbage collection (except Python or Java))
- Make use of built-in types, so I have experience using the built-in tools for real-world use (not going to write my own linked list implementation in production)

I may not have time to do all of these for every subject, but I'll try.


I don't need to memorize the guts of every algorithm.

Write code on a paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then test it out on a computer.

## Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

- Nothing to implement
- There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review
- [x] [Harvard CS50 - Asymptotic Notation (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOq5kSKqeR4)

## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [x] Description:
        - [Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/arrays-OsBSF)
        - [UC Berkeley CS61B - Linear and Multi-Dim Arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_Wp8oiO_CZZE) (Start watching from 15m 32s)
        - [Dynamic Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/dynamic-arrays-EwbnV)
        - [Jagged Arrays (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jtrQqYpt7g)
    - [x] Implement a dynamic (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [x] New raw object data array with allocated memory
            - can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features
            - start with 16, or if starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128
        - [x] size() - number of items
        - [x] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [x] is_empty()
        - [x] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [x] push(item)
        - [x] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [x] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [x] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [x] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [x] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [x] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [x] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [x] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [x] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists
    - [x] Description:
        - [x] [Singly Linked Lists (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/singly-linked-lists-kHhgK)
        - [x] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 1 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_htzJdKoEmO0)
        - [x] [CS 61B - Linked Lists 2 (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_-c4I3gFYe3w)
    - [ ] [C Code (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN6FPiD0Gzo)
            - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation
    - [x] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays-rjBs9)
        - [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures-optimizing-performance/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays-QUaUd)
    - [ ] [why you should avoid linked lists (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo)
    - [ ] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.
        - [Pointers to Pointers](https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx8.html)
    - [x] Implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [x] size() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [x] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [x] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [x] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [x] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
        - [x] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [x] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [x] front() - get value of front item
        - [x] back() - get value of end item
        - [x] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
        - [x] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [x] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
        - [x] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [x] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
    - [x] Doubly-linked List
        - [Description (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/doubly-linked-lists-jpGKD)
        - No need to implement (Not always asked in interviews)
    - [x] Time
        - O(1) to add item to the front,to get the first item,to clear the list,to delete an item at the head
        - O(n) to get the last item,to get the size,to add item to the back,to delete item at the middle of the list
    - [x] Space
        - LinkedList hold two main pieces of information(value and a pointer) per node.This Means the amount of data stored increases linearly.
        - Therefore, the space needed is O(n)
	
	

- ### Stack
    - [ ] [Stacks (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/stacks-UdKzQ)
    - [ ] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial

- ### Queue
    - [ ] [Queue (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/queues-EShpq)
    - [ ] [Circular buffer/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
    - [ ] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [ ] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [ ] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

        - remove(key)

## Sorting

- [ ] Notes:
    - Implement sorts & know best case/worst case, average complexity of each:
        - no bubble sort - it's terrible - O(n^2), except when n <= 16

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes:
    - There are 4 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - adjacency matrix
        - adjacency list
        - adjacency map
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their trade offs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none
